		This website is the geoportfolio of Kevin Lim which was made for the subject Professional Practice at RMIT Univeristy. The website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of Surveying.
		<p>
		A brief introduction about myself is that I am born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and as of September 2023, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Appled Science (Surveying) (Honours) course. My surveying-related interests include working with LiDAR, 3D modelling of infrastructure,
		photogrammetry and cadastral law. My current geospatial/surveying projects involve the assessment of SLAM drift and misalignment in featureless landscapes.
		I hope to further develop my skills in surveying, communuication and leadership after graduation.
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include travelling, movies, TV shows and the Carlton Football Club!

	<div class="academic-intro">
		Cartography consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). As part of Cartography 2, students were required to create a final map centred on any theme of their choosing.
		This map will demonstrate the cartographic skills acquired throughout Cartography 1 and 2.

			<li>Practical 2: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data of Melbourne City</li>
			<li>Practical 3: Thematic mapping of a demographic's population using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
			<li>Final Cartography Map: Free-choice on topic</li>

	<div class="bar"><h2>Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT)</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you gave done yourself-->
	<div class="academic-intro">
		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) is a unique but very practical and interesting subject done in both geospatial science and surveying. The subject uses 
		knowledge from three different disciplines:
		<ul>
			<li>Surveying</li>
			<li>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
			<li>Cartography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		For the 2020 version of the course which I completed, the assignment was about the proposal of creating an amphitheatre at Deep Rock Oval located at Yarra Bend Park.
		The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Topographic survey map of Deep Rock Oval</li>
			<li>3D generated scene of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>Amphitheatre and Pathway plan of the proposed site</li>
			<li>Final map of the amphitheatre proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The topographic survey map was created using surveying data obtained on the field using a total station at Deep Rock Oval, Yarra Bend Park.
			The topographic map was made using LISCAD.SEE and LISCAD.CAD. The 3D generated scene was created using the ArcGIS Pro.
			The proposed pathway was also created using ArcGIS Pro by using the GIS program to generate the pathway based on slope angle and the amphitheatre
			based on z-values. The final map used Adobe Illustrator to create the map along with ArcGIS for exporting the 2D amphitheathre image and ArcScene for 
			exporting the image of the 3D scene.

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2023) within the surveying industry. The company that I currently work at 
		is SMEC Australia. This page will outline my experience gained and skills I have learned from working at SMEC along with an
		overview of my current surveying skillset.

	<div class="job-overview">
		I started my employment journey with SMEC in June 2021, with no prior experience in the surveying industry. SMEC, a prominent international engineering and development firm, provided an ideal ground for my professional growth with its deep expertise in urban development and infrastructure.
		Within the survey team at the urban development department, my primary responsibilities revolved around working on greenfield estates. My roles ranged from staking and pegging of lots to control network surveys, laser scanning, asset recording, and processing fieldwork in suburbs like Rockbank, Werribee, Melton, Donnybrook, and Sunbury. My initial lack of experience was quickly mitigated through invaluable mentorship from seasoned surveyors at SMEC, who not only guided me through various survey techniques but also offered deep insights into the principles behind them, significantly contributing to my professional and technical growth in surveying.
		<p>
			Throughout my tenure, I had the unique opportunity to contribute to diverse projects, including those for Melbourne Water, which introduced me to the challenges and strategies inherent in the field of surveying. Engaging in hands-on experiences, I witnessed the transformation of lands from farms to fully developed estates and participated in various stages of land development, acquiring a breadth of technical skills along the way. My experience at SMEC has also allowed me to explore advanced technologies like LiDAR, where I operated and processed terrestrial laser scans for various significant projects, enhancing my practical knowledge and sparking my enthusiasm for cadastral surveying. This hands-on exposure bridged the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, not only making me contemplate pursuing licensure but also providing a solid foundation for my future endeavors in the surveying field.
